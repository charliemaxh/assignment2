        "3 different volatility values were simulated: 0.01,0.03 and 0.05. A line graph was generated displaying the results for each, and a table was also created containing some key figures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the results of the simulation, the simulation with the volatility of 0.01 had the least amount of variance and fluctuation compared to the other two. It generally stayed between $100 and $80 - max price of $102 and lowest of $82. This is further evidenced by the standard deviation being at a low 3.3. It can be inferred from this that a stock with a low volatility such as the one ran through the simulation could be considered a safe investment option, given it is unlikely to drastically drop in price. However, there is also limited upside as a price hike is also unlikely. It eventually ended at a loss of $17 - final price at $82 - further impying that these 'stagnant' stoccks are not nesecarily the best for investment purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The stock with volatility of 0.03 had a lot more fluctuations then the 0.01 volatility stock. It reached as high as $151 and as low as $78. The standard deviation increases to 17 further demonstartes the amount of fluctuations. This particular stock demonstartes a solid investment option - demonstarted by the moderate standard deviation as the price hikes / losses are not overly drastic. From day 150 the stock stayed above $100 for the remainder of the simulation - albeit ending on only $105. Stocks with a moderate volatility tend to have a good balance of risk versus reward and present much more upside then the 0.01 stock as well as a manageable amount of downside.\n",
        "\n",
        "The stock with volatility 0.05 has constant drastic price hikes and lows, with a large standard deviation figure of 34.9. We see prices go as high as $215 - doubling from the intial starting price - whilst also going as low as $67. Whilst its clear that stocks with a high volatility can have massive upside, it is also evident that the downside can be drastic as well. Having such major flucuations would mean it would be an unsafe investment - albeit one with the largest upside. Compared to the stock with 0.03 volatility, the balance of risk versus reward is not there, and it presents high risk and high reward.\n",
